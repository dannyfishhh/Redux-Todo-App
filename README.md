This application makes use of a Redux Store in order to handle state changes occuring in components throughout the application.

The default screen is for 3 todos but as add, remove, complete, and so forth, your own todos will be persisted in the localStorage.

There is unit testing for all of the Redux Slice logic, component testing to check the each element renders properly within each component, and changes under the correct circumstances, and also integration testing to check these elements render under the relevant user events.

The styling should be responsive to all sizes from a large laptop through to an iPhone SE.
